## Potato Disease Classification
### Overview
This project aims to classify potato plants into different disease categories, namely Late Blight, Early Blight, and Healthy. The classification is based on images of potato plants captured under various conditions and angles.

### Dataset
The dataset used for this project consists of images of potato plants affected by Late Blight, Early Blight, and healthy plants. Each image is labeled with its corresponding class.

Late Blight: Images of potato plants affected by the Late Blight disease.
Early Blight: Images of potato plants affected by the Early Blight disease.
Healthy: Images of healthy potato plants without any disease symptoms.

The dataset is split into training, validation, and test sets to train and evaluate the performance of the classification model.

### Model Architecture
The classification model is built using convolutional neural networks (CNNs), which are well-suited for image classification tasks. The architecture may include several convolutional layers followed by pooling layers for feature extraction, and fully connected layers for classification.

### Dependencies
Python 3.x
TensorFlow (or other deep learning framework)
NumPy
Matplotlib (for visualization)
Pandas (for data manipulation)
Jupyter Notebook (optional, for experimenting and visualizing)

### Usage
1. Data Preparation: Ensure that the dataset is properly organized and split into training, validation, and test sets. The dataset should be in a format compatible with the chosen deep learning framework.
2. Model Training: Train the classification model using the training dataset. Adjust hyperparameters such as learning rate, batch size, and optimizer as needed.
3. Model Evaluation: Evaluate the performance of the trained model using the validation set. Monitor metrics such as accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
4. Model Deployment: Once satisfied with the model's performance, deploy it to classify potato plant images into disease categories. You can deploy the model as a standalone application, web service, or integrate it into existing systems.

### Future Improvements
* Experiment with different CNN architectures to improve classification accuracy.
* Augment the dataset with additional images to enhance model generalization.
* Fine-tune hyperparameters and explore advanced optimization techniques for better convergence.
